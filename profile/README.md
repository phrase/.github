# Hi, we’re Phrase

Phrase helps developers manage translation and localization as part of their normal development workflow.

The Phrase Localization Platform brings together a translation management system, software localization, workflow automation, analytics, and AI-powered machine translation. It’s designed to help teams ship multilingual products faster, with automation where it makes sense and control where it matters.

Phrase Strings is our developer-focused software localization platform. It lets you manage translations directly in your existing tech stack and integrate localization cleanly into your development process.
