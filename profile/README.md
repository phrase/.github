## Software Localization Built for Developers

### API
Adjust Phrase to your workflow. [Our  API](https://developers.phrase.com/api/)  allows you to import locale files, download locale files, tag keys or interact in other ways with the localization data stored in Phrase for your account.

### CLI
The [Command Line Tool](https://help.phrase.com/help/phrase-in-your-terminal) lets you navigate your projects and translations quickly from the command line instead of fiddling around with long curl requests. Available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

### GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket Sync
Phrase offers a native GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket integration.

### Branching and Versioning
Work on [multiple releases and versions](https://help.phrase.com/help/branches) at the same time – just like in Git.

### OTA
Publish your translations faster and easier than ever before. Stop waiting for the next deployment and start publishing all your translations in real-time directly in Phrase with [Over the Air (OTA)](https://help.phrase.com/help/phrase-over-the-air-introduction).

### Webhooks
Customize your notification flow by allowing [Webhooks](https://help.phrase.com/help/webhooks) to notify external services like chat clients, project management tools or external APIs of events.

### Autofill
Let Phrase translate new content automatically using Machine Translation and Translation Memory. With [Autofill](https://help.phrase.com/help/autofill), you can automatically translate new keys, locales, or files into multiple languages directly after uploading them to Phrase.

### Formats
Phrase supports a huge variety of ways to export and import your translations for [all common localization file formats](https://help.phrase.com/help/supported-formats).
